> “Tired of typing `mkdir` and `touch` like it's 2005? Let YAML do the boring stuff.”

**`the-scaffold-project`** is a no-nonsense, YAML-driven(yet) CLI tool that instantly sets up your project's folder and file structure — with optional content — so you can get to the fun part: actually building something.

---

## 🚀 What is this?

This CLI reads a `setup.yaml` file and builds your entire project directory tree for you — files, folders, even pre-filled content. It's like `create-react-app`, but for literally **any kind of project**.

---

## 🧠 Why should you care?

Because:

* You're sick of setting up the same folder structure over and over.
* You don't trust your teammates to name folders properly.
* You want your projects to look clean, consistent, and organized.
* You want to bootstrap like a boss in 5 seconds flat.

---

## 💡 Use Cases

* 🚀 Bootstrapping React, Flask, Node, or Golang projects
* 🧪 Creating structured code environments for tutorials or workshops
* 🧰 Onboarding new devs with consistent layouts
* ⚙️ Rapid prototyping during hackathons
* 🧙 Auto-generating config files, `.env`, Dockerfiles, and GitHub Actions

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install -g the-scaffold-project
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Create a `setup.yaml` file in your current directory:

```yaml
project_name: my_cool_project
structure:
  src:
    - index.js
    - utils.js: |
        export const greet = () => console.log("Hello!");
  README.md: |
    # My Cool Project
    Auto-generated by the-scaffold-project 🚀
```

2. Run the CLI in your project directory:

```bash
npx scaffold
```

3. Boom. Folder structure created. You’re a wizard now. 🧙

---

## 🗂️ Example Output

With the above YAML, it generates:

```
my_cool_project/
├── src/
│   ├── index.js
│   └── utils.js      // with content
└── README.md         // with content
```

---

## ⚡ Features

* 🔍 Looks for `setup.yaml` in your current folder
* 🧱 Builds deep nested folder structures
* 📄 Creates files with or without inline content
* 🧹 Clean, consistent boilerplate every time
* ⚡ Fast, zero-dependency runtime (except YAML parser)

---

## ✨ Credits

Created with `mkdir`, `fs`, and **rage against repetitive setup**.
